# Zup App Backend Project

This project aims to build a RESTful API with Java and Web Application to communicate with it.

## Components

### App's Backend

The RESTful API is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project using [Jersey2](https://jersey.java.net/) and [Grizzly2](https://grizzly.java.net/).
The test were done using [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) and the coverage using [JaCoCo](http://eclemma.org/jacoco/).

### App's Frontend

The frontend part is an AngularJS web application using Bootstrap. However, is a very simple application.
It uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) for package managing and this [boilerplate](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) for a quick start.
